# Lithium
So it's basically some old presentation software for lyrics.

But more importantly...

# Lithium Recorder
Audio recording with real-time volume normalization and MP3 encoding. It's pretty cool and might actually be of use to someone.

## Usage
Simply `mvn install`, unpack `lithium-recorder/target/*-dist.zip` somewhere and try it out with one of the included shell scripts.
