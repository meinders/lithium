Changes in version 1.0 release 3
 - Fixed: Text is positioned incorrectly, such that lines with lower-than-normal
   ascent are positioned above the baseline.
 - References within the text of a lyric can now be disabled (if really needed)
   by setting the 'disableReferenceExpansion' option in your 'config.xml'.
 - Export lyric catalogs as multiple web pages: one page for each lyric,
   a table of contents for each bundle and a table of contents for the catalog.
 - New playlist file format; fixed whitespace handling.
 - Added settings for vertical margins. The resulting empty space at the top
   and/or bottom of the screen can be useful is part of the (projection) screen
   is occluded.

Changes in version 1.0 release 2
 - Fixed: Settings dialog breaks when settings are applied.
 - Prevent renaming of files in file choosers.

   In other cases, the last folder shown in a previous file chooser is used as
   a default.

 - Fixed: Search results don't show.
 - References within the text of a lyric, typically "(Chorus)", are now
   automatically expanded to the referenced content.
 - Fixed: Lyrics imported from OPS 2009 sometimes contain format-specific
   annotations, e.g. "[split]". These are now removed.
 - Fixed: In certain unusual situations, the view crashes while fading in or out.
